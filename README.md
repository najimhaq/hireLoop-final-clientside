## **The Modern Job Hunting Portal**

## **Overview**

HireLoop is a full-featured job hunting portal that bridges the gap between job seekers and employers. It streamlines job discovery, application management, and company recruitment — all in one platform.

It offers smart job search, company profiles, subscription-based premium features, and a recruiter toolkit, enhancing hiring speed and candidate experience.

Designed for both individuals and organizations, HireLoop simplifies the talent acquisition process while ensuring a transparent, fast, and data-driven hiring experience.

## **User Roles**

The HireLoop system is built around three core user roles — **Seeker**, **Recruiter**, and **Admin** — each responsible for distinct parts of the hiring workflow. Their coordinated interactions ensure a seamless end-to-end job marketplace experience.
